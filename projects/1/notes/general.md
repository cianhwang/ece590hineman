# Some suggested questions for RL algorithms

1. Is the algorithm on-policy or off-policy? What does this mean for exploration-exploitation?
2. From what principle is the algorithm derived? For example, did it come from direct optimization of returns of the Bellman equation? Said another way, what are the key equations?
3. Can you give a simple derivation or at least consistency argument for its update?
4. Can you write a practical algorithm? That is, how would code up the mathematics?
5. Did the algorithm come from a paper? Which paper was it, when? What else is in the paper that is maybe not in the spinning up documentation?
6. Did the paper offer any mathematical guarantees? If so, what are they?
7. At the time the paper was written, what was the novelty of the algorithm?
